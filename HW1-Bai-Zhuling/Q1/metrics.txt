Average Node Degree:1.047
Meaning: Average number of edges a node connects to other nodes in this graph.

Diameter of the graph:5
Meaning: Once the shortes path length from every node to all other nodes is 
calculated, the diameter is the longest of all the calculated path length.
Diameter is representative of the linear size of a network.

Average path length:2.955
Meaning: On average, the number of steps it takes to get from one node of 
the graph to another.
